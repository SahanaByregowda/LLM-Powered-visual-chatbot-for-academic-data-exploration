# Awarding Universities' Study Programmes

## Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH)

The master’s programme in Computer Science offers a broad education in the field. Students gain a strong foundation in advanced algorithms, computer security, artificial intelligence, and internet protocols, while developing expertise through specialised tracks. Graduates pursue careers at the forefront of software-based technologies, such as software engineers, game developers, and IT project managers, or continue to PhD studies to build careers in research laboratories or academia.

## Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski

This HPC MSc programme introduces students to cutting-edge HPC technologies and develops the skills needed to fully harness the potential of the world’s largest supercomputers and multicore processors. The HPC MSc programme is designed for graduates of Mathematics and/or Computer Science, Computational Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Natural Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology, Geography), and related degrees.

## Sorbonne Université

High Performance Computing plays a major role in scientific research and industrial innovation. The architecture of large-scale computers is evolving rapidly, becoming increasingly complex. These computers consist of heterogeneous units, with the number of computing cores now exceeding one million. The advent of exascale computing capability offers promising new opportunities for scientific computing but necessitates new algorithms, as well as a deep understanding of computer architectures, parallel algorithms and programming, and mathematical modelling.

## Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)

The master’s programme in Computational Engineering comprises a seminar, three sections—Mathematics, Computer Science, and Technical Application Field—and the master’s thesis, totalling 120 ECTS. There is a standard study plan for each TAF. However, in the master’s programme, all modules are elective. Students can choose modules from the CE module catalogue for the various master’s studies in the departments of Computer Science, Engineering, Applied Mathematics, and Physics.

* **Computer Science (Informatik):** Students may select modules from the CE module catalogue offered by the Computer Science Chairs for the master’s programme in Computer Science.
* **Technical Application Field (Technisches Anwendungsfach, TAF):** In this section, students can choose modules from the CE module catalogue offered by all master’s programmes in the School of Engineering, except for those from the Department of Computer Science. The Technical Application Field includes up to seven focus areas, such as Thermo- and Fluid Dynamics, Computational Materials Science, among others.

## Politecnico di Milano

The study programme in High Performance Computing Engineering is a two-year course with a curriculum of 120 credits (Laurea Magistrale / Master’s Degree, degree class LM-32 – Computer Systems Engineering).

* The first year offers a range of courses related to parallel computing and programming, high-performance parallel processors, cloud infrastructures and data centres, numerical analysis, and applied statistics.
* The second year includes courses in Quantum Computing and heterogeneous HPC systems based on accelerators (GPUs and tensor cores).
* Additionally, there will be 20 credits dedicated to the application of HPC in various engineering domains, as well as a final thesis project (20 credits) that can be undertaken in an industry-oriented context or abroad.

## Université du Luxembourg

The Master in High Performance Computing (HPC) at the University of Luxembourg is a 2-year innovative Master’s programme that trains the next generation of HPC experts in Luxembourg and Europe. Graduates of the programme will be able to work in the following fields: numerical and data analyst, performance analyst and advisor, HPC architecture, system development and support. Doctoral Programme in High Performance Computing in Luxembourg (University of Luxembourg, LIST, LIH).

## Università della Svizzera Italiana (USI)

Designed to align with students’ unique interests and career goals, the programme offers three specialised tracks for a targeted educational experience:

* **High-Performance Computing (HPC):** Concentrates on large-scale computing and optimisation techniques, equipping students for careers in sectors that demand high computational capabilities.
* **Data Science:** Focuses on the analysis and interpretation of data to understand complex systems and relationships, making it suitable for those interested in studying interconnected phenomena.
* **Simulations:** Centres on the development and interpretation of simulations, applicable in diverse fields such as engineering and biomedical research.

## Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)

Advanced Computing is a discipline that approaches complex computational problems from both theoretical and practical perspectives. It views algorithms—i.e., the human or mechanical processes of transforming data—as subjects for systematic study. The aim is to understand their limitations and capabilities and to utilise these insights to provide novel and more efficient algorithmic solutions.

The specialisation is aimed at students with a background in computer science, computer engineering, or mathematics who can demonstrate a solid grounding in fundamental algorithms, programming skills, and basic knowledge of discrete mathematics. Students from other scientific and technological backgrounds are also welcome, but they may be required to undertake a bachelor-level course to ensure that the necessary prerequisites are met.
