# Extracurricular Activities in Studies

## Summer School

The summer school is a key event within the programme, offering a vital opportunity for networking and fostering connections among EUMaster4HPC students from various participating universities. It also brings together selected students from related Master’s programmes at partner universities, distinguished professors, and stakeholders from supercomputing centres and industry. This collaborative environment encourages knowledge exchange, supports interdisciplinary learning, and paves the way for future collaborations and professional endeavours.

### EUMaster4HPC Summer School Overview
* **2023**: HPC for Environmental Aspects
* **2024**: HPC in Data Science
* **2025**: HPC for Specialised Applications (Registrations are open)

## Workshops

Workshops will be conducted at participant universities to foster a sense of community among students and provide a platform for presenting industrial and research needs in the fields of High-Performance Computing and High-Performance Data Analytics. Each student will have the chance to engage in a minimum of three workshops, scheduled during the middle of semesters 1, 2, and 3. These workshops serve as valuable forums for collaboration, knowledge sharing and networking, enhancing the overall educational experience and preparing students for the challenges ahead in their academic and professional journeys.

### Workshops Overview
* **2023**: HPC and Multidisciplinary Fields
* **2024**:
    * Fundamentals of accelerated computing with CUDA C/C++ and Python
    * Career Day and BSC Quantic Group Presentation
* **2025**:
    * 28/02/2025 – Insights into careers in HPC and HPDA
    * 19/03/2025 – Accelerating CUDA C++ Applications with Multiple GPUs
    * 26/03/2025 – Scaling CUDA C++ Applications to Multiple Nodes
    * 01/04/2025 – Mastering MATLAB: From Parallel Programming to HPC Integration
    * 02/04/2025 – Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA Python
    * 16/04/2025 – Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with OpenACC
    * 06/06/2025 – Introduction to FPGA computing with Intel oneAPI on MeluXina
    * 16/06/2025 – HPC and Quantum Computing

## Challenges

Students will participate in up to two challenge competitions aimed at solving real-world industrial and research problems within the field of High-Performance Computing. These challenges, organised by leading supercomputing centres and held virtually, serve as a preparatory step for international competitions. Additionally, they offer valuable opportunities to collaborate with industry partners, providing students with practical insights and enhancing their learning experience.

### EUMaster4HPC Student Challenge Overview
* **2023/2024**: PSO Algorithm Acceleration with a Simple 5-Stage Teaching Processor
* **2024/2025**: Benchmarking and regression testing of a Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation application in HPC system.

## Masterships

The last part to complete the master programme usually done in the 4th semester is a larger practical task. It is called master thesis or internship and sums up to 30 ECTS. It is recommended that the students choose from a list topics coming from universities, computing centres or industry which are validated by the EUMaster4HPC internship committee lead by UNITO, composed by UNIPV, SU, CINECA, ETP4HPC, uni.lu and URCA.

This training period within a company or a research centre is of great importance for students in giving them the opportunity to practice and gain a first experience improving their employability.

To follow the rules from the first and second year university students are required to have also a local supervisor from each involved university.
