# EUMaster4HPC Challenge 2023-2024: Accelerating the PSO Algorithm with RISC-V

News from Tuesday 20 August 2024

In this article, we explore the highlights and outcomes of the EUMaster4HPC Challenge 2023-2024, a key event for advancing high-performance computing skills and fostering innovation among our students.

## Overview of the EUMaster4HPC Challenge

The EUMaster4HPC Challenge, which ran from October 2023 to January 2024, was undertaken by 18 students grouped into three teams, involving approximately 40 hours of intense work. This challenge aimed to push the boundaries of technology for the first cohort of the EUMaster4HPC programme. Led by Dr. Tadej Murovič, European University Programme Lead at Codasip, the challenge offered invaluable insights and mentorship throughout.

## Objective: Accelerating the PSO Algorithm

The primary goal of this year's challenge was to accelerate the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm using a 5-stage RISC-V teaching processor. PSO is a highly effective population-based optimisation algorithm used across various domains, including data mining, image processing, and engineering optimisation.

Students utilised Codasip Studio to design and implement custom instructions and hardware to boost the PSO algorithm's performance. The challenge focused on integrating hardware acceleration techniques to enhance the speed and efficiency of the PSO algorithm on the RISC-V processor architecture.

## Tools and Techniques

Codasip Studio was central to the challenge, offering a high-level environment for CPU design with the CodAL language, which features a C-like syntax. This tool allowed students to create and test custom hardware configurations crucial for optimising the PSO algorithm.

## Impact and Insights

The EUMaster4HPC Challenge not only provided hands-on experience in advanced CPU design but also demonstrated the power of RISC-V architecture and hardware acceleration. The challenge highlighted the potential of these technologies in solving complex, real-world problems and showcased the innovative approaches of the participants.
