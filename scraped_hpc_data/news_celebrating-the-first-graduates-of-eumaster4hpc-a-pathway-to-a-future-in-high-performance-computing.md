News from Tuesday 15 October 2024

In a historic moment for Europe’s high-performance computing sector, the EUMaster4HPC consortium celebrated the graduation of its inaugural cohort at the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) on 11 October 2024. This milestone recognises the accomplishments of these pioneering graduates and inspires future students eager to shape the HPC landscape. As they begin their careers, these graduates are well-equipped to tackle the complex challenges of HPC and lead advancements in supercomputing.

In a significant milestone for Europe’s high-performance computing landscape, the EUMaster4HPC consortium celebrated the graduation of its inaugural cohort at the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) on 11 October 2024. This landmark event not only highlights the achievements of these pioneering graduates but also inspires prospective students eager to shape the future of HPC.

## Unleashing Potential Through a Cutting-Edge Programme

The first graduating class of EUMaster4HPC successfully navigated a demanding two-year curriculum. This programme is funded by the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, with a budget of €7 million. As the first pan-European Master’s programme dedicated exclusively to HPC, EUMaster4HPC unites eight prestigious universities and over 60 partners across 23 EuroHPC participant countries. Thus, this unique collaboration ensures that graduates acquire advanced skills essential for tackling evolving challenges in the HPC landscape.

## Hands-On Experience and Real-World Application

What sets this programme apart is its emphasis on real-world learning. Graduates engaged in internships, workshops, and collaborative projects. Consequently, they gained hands-on experience that bridges theoretical knowledge and practical application. These experiences enable students to confront genuine HPC challenges while collaborating with industry leaders, ensuring they are job-ready upon graduation.

During their studies, these graduates participated in significant events like the EuroHPC Summits, the ISC High-Performance or the ETP4HPC Conferences. Here, they had opportunities to network with policymakers, researchers, and industry experts. Thus, they further enhanced their understanding of the field and its future directions.

## International Mobility and Diverse Perspectives

A hallmark of the EUMaster4HPC programme is its commitment to international mobility, which enriches graduates' educational experiences. Each student had the opportunity to study in multiple countries, adapting to various research environments and cultures. In their first year, they attended one of eight renowned institutions across Europe—Luxembourg, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Bulgaria, or Switzerland. In their second year, they studied at one of the seven other university aligned with their specialisation. This global exposure not only broadens academic horizons but also cultivates a culturally aware and adaptable skill set, essential for success in today’s interconnected world.

## Inspiring the Next Generation

Anders Jensen, Executive Director of the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, emphasised the importance of this first graduating class during the ceremony. He remarked, “The graduation of this first cohort marks a moment of immense pride for the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, and I eagerly look forward to attending many more graduation ceremonies in the years ahead. A world-class supercomputing ecosystem in Europe is impossible without talented, highly skilled professionals like you. You are the future of European supercomputing and our greatest asset!"

Furthermore, the accomplishments of these graduates signify a collaborative effort involving over 100 academic and industry partners dedicated to nurturing HPC talent across Europe.

## A Call to Future Leaders

As this first cohort embarks on their careers, they are well-positioned to make substantial contributions to the HPC field. Equipped with the knowledge and experience necessary to tackle complex computational challenges, they will find opportunities in various areas, from scientific research to industrial innovation.

Prospective students considering the EUMaster4HPC programme can take inspiration from this inaugural class. By joining this pioneering initiative, you too can become part of a transformative journey, emerging not just as a graduate but as a catalyst for change in the high-performance computing landscape.

## Your Future Starts Here

The EUMaster4HPC programme is more than just an educational experience; it’s a pathway to becoming a future leader in HPC. By following in the footsteps of these pioneering graduates, you can drive innovation and contribute to a digitally empowered Europe.
