## Academic Programme

Confirmed academic lectures encompass the fields of data science, modelling and simulation, cybersecurity, biology, civil engineering, aeronautical engineering, physics, chemistry, and materials science. These will be delivered by a total of eight lecturers, who are selected participants of the EuroCC2 project, hold degrees in HPC, and/or are active users of HPC resources. Additional speakers from among the EUMaster4HPC project partners will also be invited.

## Industry Programme

Several companies will contribute to the technical programme of the Summer School, either by supporting hands-on training or by presenting their HPC-related activities and general sector requirements. As with the academic lectures, diversity of subject areas has been prioritised in the selection of these companies.

## Social Programme

To encourage socialising and team building among the students, a two-day weekend trip is planned to the popular World Heritage Site of Cappadocia (Fairy Chimneys), with an overnight stay. The tour will include visits to Salt Lake, Ihlara Valley, the Underground City, Göreme Open-Air Museum, and Avanos pottery workshop. Wine-tasting tours, pottery making, horseback riding, and hot air balloon rides are also available at an additional cost.

During the weekdays, additional tours on campus are planned. These include visits to the TRUBA Supercomputing Centre, Design Factory, Centre for Wind Energy Research (METUWIND), Society and Science Centre Exhibitions (Open-Air Exhibition, Classical Automobile Exhibition, Planetarium, Science and Technology History Exhibition), and Eymir Lake.

## Location

The Summer School will be held at the Graduate School of Informatics building on the METU Campus, Ankara, Türkiye. Within the building, two classrooms, a conference hall, an amphitheatre, a computer lab, and the main entrance hall are reserved exclusively for this event. The students will have access to TÜBİTAK TRUBA’s supercomputing resources throughout the Summer School.

METU is a state university with a dedicated campus. It is an international institution, and all courses are taught in English. It ranks as the top university in Turkey and is in the top 400 universities globally according to the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings. The campus spans 4,500 hectares, with 3,043 hectares designated as forested area, including Lake Eymir, which is situated approximately 20 kilometres from the centre of Ankara.

## Accommodation

Students will stay in the university’s dormitories on campus. Rooms are available for 2 to 4 occupants, with either shared or en-suite facilities. A limited number of single rooms with en-suite or shared facilities are also available. Participants will be able to select their accommodation preference from the available options at the time of registration. Reservations will be made on a first-come, first-served basis. However, accommodation is guaranteed for a maximum of 80 students.

Students who prefer to stay at a hotel off-campus may do so at their own expense, but they will need to arrange their own transport to and from the campus.

## Catering

A breakfast plate will be provided for participants at the Cafeteria Café. Set-menu lunches will be served in the university’s main cafeteria. For dinner, there are several à la carte restaurants both on and near the campus.

## Travel and Transportation

METU is 38 km from Esenboğa Airport in Ankara. There are frequent buses to and from the city centre. A taxi ride takes around 45 minutes and costs approximately 30 euros.

Ankara is the capital of Turkey and is well connected to many European cities by direct flights or via Istanbul Airport. The city is also accessible by a short flight from Mediterranean coastal cities such as Bodrum, Fethiye, Marmaris, and Antalya. Frequent charter flights operate between these popular holiday destinations and various European cities during the summer.

There is no visa requirement for passport holders from most EU countries. For others, e-visa applications can be made online.
