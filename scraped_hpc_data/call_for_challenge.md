Context
The European Master in High Performance Computing (EUMaster4HPC) aims to develop an innovative European Master’s programme focused on high-performance computing solutions. EUMaster4HPC brings together key players in HPC education across Europe, mobilising them to consolidate existing programmes into a unified European curriculum.

The third cohort of EUMaster4HPC students began their studies in September 2024 at the eight awarding universities: Friedrich-Alexander-Universität, Sorbonne Université, Università della Svizzera italiana, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Politecnico di Milano, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski.

All students are required to complete a challenge during the third semester (between September 2025 and February 2026) before embarking on their internship. The challenge involves solving an industrial or scientific problem using HPC, working in groups of three to four students. At the end of the challenge, students must submit a report and defend their work before a panel of judges

Submit your proposal before 1 June 2025.
