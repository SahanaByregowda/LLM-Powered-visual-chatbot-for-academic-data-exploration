* **Preferred for Year 1:** Your preferred university for your first year of study.
* **Preferred for Year 2:** Your preferred university for your second year of study.
* **Alternative option:** Indicate an alternative university in case either your first or second choice does not accept your application.

Please be aware that while your choices will be considered, they may not be granted. The selection committee may also offer an alternative pathway based on availability and programme requirements.

## Documents needed to complete the application

* Curriculum vitae (CV) / Resume.
* Letter of motivation: Please ensure that you mention your intention to enrol in the EUMaster4HPC programme in your letter.
* Academic transcripts.
* University diploma: If your studies are still in progress, provide an official certificate issue by your university, stating the expected completion date.

## Scholarship and financial support

The scholarships previously offered by the project to the last three cohorts will not be available for the upcoming intake.

However, to secure financial support, students are encouraged to reach out directly to their chosen universities to explore the options they may offer. Universities may have scholarships or other forms of financial assistance available.

Additionally, for self-funded students, there are often opportunities to work part-time to help cover living expenses. It may also be helpful to inquire whether universities have partnerships with local businesses or offer job placement services to assist in finding employment.
